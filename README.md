# Multimodal-ML-Housing-Price-Prediction-Using-Images-Tabular-Data-New Project Launch: Multimodal Housing Price Prediction 🏡
I’m excited to share my latest machine learning project where I built a Multimodal Deep Learning model that predicts house prices using both images 🖼️ and tabular data 📊.
🔹 Model Highlights
CNN for image feature extraction
MLP for structured/tabular features
Fusion architecture combining both modalities
Built with TensorFlow/Keras
🔹 Deployment
Interactive app built in Streamlit
Integrated preprocessing (scaler + feature handling)
Hosted live so anyone can test it!

This project was a great opportunity to explore multimodal ML, model fusion, and deployment pipelines.
 Would love to hear your feedback and ideas for improvement 🙌
